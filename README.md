This module was adapted for REDCap version 12.0.0. It has been orphaned (i.e., lacks any funding for changes), so if you'd like to adopt it, it's yours for the taking. You can change the primary author to yourself instead of Scott Pearson. I'm happy to correspond via email if there are any questions.
